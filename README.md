# WheelchAI
All code related to the ["DROW: Real-Time Deep Learning based Wheelchair Detection in 2D Range Data"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02636) paper.

# Under construction
We already created this repo to allow for sharing links in advance and possibly have discussion in the issues. We're waiting for feedback on the paper and will publish code for running and training DROW in the near future.

Preliminary, guarantee-free, AS-IS code for running in ROS is available in the [STRANDS repositories](https://github.com/strands-project/strands_perception_people/tree/indigo-devel/wheelchair_detector).
